        //~*~ Welcome to Java Arrays[] ~*~
        //Key differences coming from JS: a. arrays have a fixed length that we **must** set, b. arrays have a set data type [with all elements matching].
        //** Structure **
        //double[] prices;

        //datatype[] varName (gets us going, but we'd still need to take another step to give the array a length):
        //prices = new double[4];

        //TODO Together: Let's set up our first array - an array of prices with a double datatype.

        //TODO Together: Nice! So, we can set up an array with a literal (prices = new double[4], diceSides = new int[6], groceryList = new String[10]), but that's not all. We can also use a constant or variable!

        //~*~ Array Elements ~*~

        //Similarities from JS: Array elements are referred to by their Array[index] beginning with 0.
        //Elements also come with default values = 0/0.0, false, \0, or null depending on the type.

        //TODO Together: Let's see some of these defaults in action from our prior examples.

        //TODO Together: What if we try to refer to an index beyond what we have set up?

        //TODO Together: We can use the ARRAY INITIALIZER to set up not only our array and its length, but the elements inside as well!

        //TODO: Build your first Java array! Feel free to use the array initializer or otherwise, but take time to make an array of your choosing and then test it out with a System.out.print of some kind to check an element within to satisfaction.
        //TODO Example: String[] myPets = new String[2]; myPets[0] = "Fluffy"; myPets[1] = "Spot"; OR: String[] myPets = {"Fluffy", "Spot"}. System.out.print(myPets[0]) // Fluffy

        //~*~ Iterating Arrays ~*~
        //for + .length:
//TODO Together: A for loop [for(init;cond;count){}] can perform similar iteration tasks as we had used it for in JS.

        //enhanced for (loop : loops){}
        //TODO Together: Java also provides an enhanced for [for (ele : arr) {}] to use!

        //TODO: Using the array you set up above, practice iterating through the array using both of our types of for loops. When might you choose to use one over the other?

        //~*~ Java array.methods() ~*~
        //We have access to a variety of pre-built static methods in the java.util.Arrays class

        //void Arrays.fill(arrayName, value) = let's fill all elements in the array provided with the given value.
        //TODO Together: An empty groceryList isn't going to work - let's at least get something in there. Everyone loves ice cream, right?

        //array Arrays.copyOf(myArray, arrLength) = let's make a clean copy of myArray up to arrLength element
        //TODO Together: Well, that was certainly a lot of ice cream. I think we overdid it though - maybe three pints of ice cream would suffice for a weekend ice cream party.


        //Arrays.equals(arr1, arr2) = T/F: are both arrays the same type and all the elements equal?
        //TODO Together: Let's demonstrate .equals() by comparing our ice cream party lists:

        //~*~ More Array.methods() ~*~

        //Arrays.toString(arr) = returns a String representation of the array including the brackets
        //TODO Together: We have an array of Cohorts in this file - let's stringify that array.

        //TODO Together: We do get the brackets back with the method, but let's solve that with a little method chain-chain-chain as an example of what you could do:

        //Arrays.sort(arr) - Sort elements of array into ascending order
        //TODO Together: Hey, Oberon and Neptune are out of line in our array - .sort might help us out there!

        //Arrays.binarySearch(array, value) = returns int index of value when found, negative number when not found
        //TODO Together: Let's demonstrate binarySearch by looking for a couple cohorts in our array.

        //TODO: We've covered a lot of different methods so far - pick at least two(2) to experiment with below with either an array from the lecture, your earlier array you built, or a brand new array for this TODO.

        //~*~ 2d Arrays (enter the matrix) ~*~

        //2d Arrays (commonly referred to as an array matrix) are daunting to encounter for the first time. . but, imagine you are working with a grid/spreadsheet

        //TODO Together: Let's utilize the example from the slide to dive into this concept:

        int[][] matrix = {
                {1, 2, 3}, //row 1
                {4, 5, 6}, //row 2
                {7, 8, 9}  //row 3
        };

        for (int[] row : matrix) { //an individual int array from our array of arrays
            System.out.println("+---+---+---+");
            System.out.print("| ");

            for (int number : row) { //an individual number from our int array
                System.out.print(number + " | ");
            }

            System.out.println();
        }
        System.out.println("+---+---+---+");

        System.out.println("matrix[0][0] = " + matrix[0][0]); //row 1, col 1

        //TODO Interactive: Help me out here, if matrix[0][0] worked as demonstrated above, can you help me print out the "5" and "9"?

        //TODO: Emergency! Emergency! Alien invaders have been detected at int 6, int 7, and int 2 in our grid area! Dispatch our MIB forces to the appropriate parts of the array by finishing my System.outs!

        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("ALERT ** ALERT ** ALERT **");
        System.out.println("|| ALIEN ACTIVITY DETECTED IN OUR GRID ||");
        System.out.println("** ALERT ** ALERT ** ALERT");
        System.out.println("Deploying MIB personnel to counter alien activity!");
        // System.out.println("MIB Officer Douglas H. headed to grid area " + matrix[?][?] + "!"); //should say "grid area 6!"
        // System.out.println("MIB Officer Larry C. headed to grid area " + matrix[?][?] + "!"); //should say "grid area 7!"
        // System.out.println("MIB Officer Kenneth H. headed to grid area " + matrix[?][?] + "!"); //should say "grid area 2!"
